This repository contains Rust exercises inspired by "The Rust Programming Language" book (commonly known as "The Book"). It serves as a practical workspace to implement and experiment with Rust concepts through small projects.

## Features

- A simple guessing game implemented in Rust demonstrating basic input/output, control flow, and random number generation.
- Reference folder presumably containing additional learning materials or code snippets (details not specified).

## Tech Stack

- Rust programming language
- rand crate for random number generation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust toolchain installed (https://rustup.rs/)

### Running the Guessing Game

1. Navigate to the guessing_game directory:

   ```sh
   cd guessing_game
   ```

2. Build and run the project using Cargo:

   ```sh
   cargo run
   ```

3. Follow the on-screen prompts to play the guessing game.

## Project Structure

```
rust_exercises/
├── guessing_game/       # Rust project implementing a number guessing game
│   ├── src/
│   │   └── main.rs      # Main source code for the guessing game
│   └── Cargo.toml       # Cargo manifest for the guessing game
├── Reference/           # Additional reference materials (contents unspecified)
└── README.md            # This file
```

## Future Work / Roadmap

- Expand exercises to cover more Rust language features and idioms.
- Add documentation and comments to existing code for clarity.
- Include tests and benchmarks where applicable.
- Populate the Reference directory with curated learning resources or code examples.
- Possibly modularize the guessing game for reuse or extension.
