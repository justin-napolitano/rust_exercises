This repo is all about practicing Rust through hands-on exercises inspired by "The Rust Programming Language." It's an experimental playground for implementing Rust concepts with simple projects.

### Key Components:
- **Guessing Game:** A basic game that showcases Rust's input/output, control flow, and random number generation using the `rand` crate.
- **Reference Folder:** Contains additional learning materials or code snippets (details are light here).

### Getting Started:
1. Make sure you have the Rust toolchain set up. Install it from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).
2. Go to the guessing game directory:
   ```sh
   cd guessing_game
   ```
3. Build and run the game with:
   ```sh
   cargo run
   ```
4. Just follow the prompts to play.

### Gotchas:
- Ensure your Rust toolchain is up to date to avoid compatibility issues.
- Check the structure if you want to navigate and extend the projects.
